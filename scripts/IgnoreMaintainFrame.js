// Description:
// Ignore the maintain frame setting during character minimization. (created Rydian)

// Walkthrough: 
// When you change the framerate and save the options screen,
// the game writes the value somewhere.  This is a different
// address than the temporary one it uses while in the options.
// Change this operation to load from ebp, which holds an
// address, which will be a value much larger than the FPS we
// can ever obtain in Mabinogi, because it runs like crap.
//
// 89 4E 50              - mov [esi+50],ecx
// Becomes
// 89 6E 50              - mov [esi+50],ebp
