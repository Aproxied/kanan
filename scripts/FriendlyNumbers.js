// Originally from Step29 and kotarou3.

// This script inserts commas in long numbers such as the price of items.

// These are the steps I followed to create this script:
// Have Rydian send you a picture of where the price of an item is being read
// from memory.
//
// Or find the function that references the string:
// code.interface.window.buy.price_text
// which will have the instruction that reads the number close by.
//
// Reverse the functions that are called after the price has been read from
// memory.
// Notice that one of the functions references the string `%s`.
// This is the 'format string' string which means the number is being converted
// to a string prior to that function being called.
// Look above to see the function called immediately after reading the price
// and notice that its return value is being fed into the format string
// function we found.
// That function is the one that converts an integer to a string.
// Reverse that function and find a call to a function that calls itow_s
// multipul times.
// itow_s converts an integer to a wide string.
// Notice that the actual itow_s calls don't seem to be called all that
// regularly though.
// Notice that the function also references the string `%d`.
// This is the 'format decimal' string, which means this could also be
// converting our number.
// Notice that this part of the function is called as expected.
// Intercept the function and fix the number on return.

    onLeave(retval) {

        var str = Memory.readUtf16String(strPtr);

        // Add commas to it.
        str = str.replace(/\B(?=(\d{3})+(?!\d))/g, ',');
